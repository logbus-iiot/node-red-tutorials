## 🚀 What is Node-RED?

Node-RED is an open-source, flow-based development tool built on Node.js that enables the creation of logic flows using a browser-based editor. It’s especially powerful for Internet of Things (IoT) applications where devices, data, and systems need to be connected quickly and flexibly.

### 🏭 Node-RED for Industrial IoT at LogBus
At **LogBus**, we use Node-RED as a foundational tool in our Industrial IoT (IIoT) stack. We specialize in helping **chiller technicians**, building engineers, and service professionals remotely monitor and troubleshoot complex mechanical systems such as:

- TurboCor chiller compressors
- Multistack and Carrier chillers
- Boilers, cooling towers, and hydronic systems
- BACnet and Modbus-based field devices
- UPC-AU proprietary protocols

### 📡 How We Use Node-RED

- **Data Logging**: Node-RED connects to chillers, boilers, and BMS controllers to extract telemetry and store it in cloud databases.
- **Secure Remote Access**: Node-RED nodes interact with VPN tunnels, HTTP proxies, and device APIs, enabling authorized users to access embedded web UIs, VNC sessions, and service tools like the Turbocor Monitor.
- **Alerts and Visualizations**: Flows are built to watch for abnormal behaviors and stream data into dashboards for real-time and historical insight.
- **Protocol Translation**: Node-RED helps bridge protocols like Modbus and BACnet to MQTT and HTTP for wider compatibility and integration.

### 🌍 LogBus in Action
From our cloud platform, technicians can:

- View long-term performance trends of chillers
- Remotely change controller settings through secure tunnels
- Launch full-service sessions with OEM tools — without needing to travel

> **"LogBus is your building automation and energy management system in the cloud."**

Our system empowers maintenance and support staff to do more, faster — without changing lanes on the highway just to diagnose a compressor.
